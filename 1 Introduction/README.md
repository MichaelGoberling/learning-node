# 1 Introduction

## Summary

In this section, we will be installing Node.js on the computer, understanding its role theoretically as a technology solution, and implementing some simple examples to get us started actually using Node.js.

## Notes

### Installing Node.js and Creating our First App

Installing Node.js on Windows is as easy as running an executable obtained from the Node website.

There are two ways to run Node.js code. First, you can simply run `node` to gain access to an interpretator that will allow you to submit statements that Node.js will evaluate and return values for. Alternatively, you can run `node <filename>` to run all the code contained in a file, and Node.js will evaluate that code.

`console.log()` allows you to print values to the screen.

There is a library called `fs` which enables interaction with the host operating system. To write a file to the system, you can use the `writeFileSync(filename, valuesToWrite)` function.
