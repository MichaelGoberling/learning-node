# 3 Understanding the Basics

## Summary

In this section, we will be learning about how to set up a basic Node.js web server that handles requests and responses. We will be learning a little bit about how Node.js works under the hood, particularly with respect to the Event Loop.

## Notes

### Module Introduction

An initial look into what the module will contain. It sounds like we may be setting up a simple Express application that handles and parses some requests, while serving up some static data.

### How the Web Works

The common request/response architecture of the web was outlined and it was specified that this course is mainly focused on writing the code that is running on the server that is accepting requests. The server may be sitting behind a DNS and in that case, it will resolve into the IP address for the server.

It also noted that your server may communicate with a database that is running on another server in order to persistently store application specific data.

Information returned from the server can be JSON, a file, and more.
